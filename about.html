            I have always wanted to be a software engineer. I donâ€™t remember when I fell in love with computers and software or technology, but over the years, my passion for programming has increased. Over the past few months, I have started living this as a true and no more a dream, and it gives me so much joy. And that's what tends to make me do this website. Not only for me, but for people who are studying computer science and don't know where to start. I mean, even if you are going to collage, you may want to study on your own for sometimes. This website might help you to get through that. Some of you might think that we are going to the collage to pursue a computer science degree. Why would I need this? Well, it completely depends on you. But remember, you cannot completely rely on the collage courses, sometimes or most of the times you have to do it on your own. Remember that I am a student too. Please text me if I said something wrong or gave any incorrect information about the posts that I would be publishing on my blog site, I will immediately try to figure it out and improve myself over the time. And also remember that I am not going to teach you any stuff on these blog's; rather, I will post some useful links and resources that will help you. And I am going to share my projects, if any that I am working on. I will publish them in my <a href="https://www.github.com/ruthvik4215" class="github-page">Github page</a>.

            There are many things I have to learn and want to learn. The first thing that I want to learn is web development. The number of things I can make on a website is limited like ( HTML, CSS, Jquery, Javascript ). However, while making the website, I realized the happiness and satisfaction I get from looking at it. Yes, it is obvious that websites are not just made of HTML, CSS, Jquery, Javascript all of these are categorised in front-end web development, but there is back-end too which  I think is a must for any website to at least perform some basic functionality. I am going to look into that in the future like node.js, express, react native.

            One more thing that I want to learn is machine learning. I love how the modern world is using machine learning to improve their business strategy for targeting a specific group of people using ML techniques. I will discuss more about that in my machine learning blog, visit that if you are interested in it.
